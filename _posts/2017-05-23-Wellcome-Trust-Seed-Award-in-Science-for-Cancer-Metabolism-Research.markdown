Giovanni Stracquadanio has been awarded the highly competitive Wellcome Trust
Seed Award in Science to conduct a study on cancer metabolism under hypoxia and
starvation.

This study will lead to both biological and computational results, including the
identification of key genes in metabolic reprogramming and a new network
clustering algorithm for pathway discovery and data fusion.

The award will support Dr Stracquadanio for 2 years with Â£100,000.
