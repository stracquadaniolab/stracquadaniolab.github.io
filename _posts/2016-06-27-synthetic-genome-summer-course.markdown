I will give a talk at the ["Synthetic Genome Summer School"](https://syntheticgenomes.wordpress.com/) at University of
Edinburgh, which runs from Sunday 3rd July â€“ Saturday 9th July 2016.  
I will present Computer Aided Design and Analysis methods for synthetic genomics,
covering design and workflow tools as well as the analysis of SCRaMbLE experiments.
