Applications are invited for a Senior Research Officer (Post Doctoral Research Associate - PDRA) position in computational biology to work on a Wellcome Trust funded project aiming at identifying pathways altered by starvation and hypoxia in cancer. The project is developed in close collaboration with clinicians and biologists at the University of Oxford.

This is a fixed term appointment of 20 months (starting on  February 2018, grade 8/SP30) to work in the "Computational Intelligence Lab for Biology and Medicine" (CIBM, www.stracquadanio.me) led by Dr Giovanni Stracquadanio at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the University of Essex.
The CIBM is developing data analysis algorithms that take advantage of big biological datasets to generate testable hypotheses of disease susceptibility, progression and outcome. Dr Stracquadanio is at the forefront of computational biology and has published in high-impact journals, including Science, Nature Rev. Cancer, Cancer Research and Genome Research.

Duties of the Role
The PDRA will develop algorithms to identify pathways associated with cancer from transcriptomic and proteomic data. This will involve developing methods for network clustering and data fusion based on generative models and optimisation algorithms. The PDRA is expected to deliver robust, industry-level implementations of these methods and promote their use in the broader scientific community.


The PDRA will be also responsible for analysing and interpreting experimental results, and presenting research outputs, including preparing research articles, scientific presentations and preliminary data for grant applications. The PDRA will also supervise junior members of the lab when appropriate.

DESIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE

The ideal candidate will have a PhD in Computer Science, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics or Mathematics, and a strong background in optimisation and/or statistical analysis. Excellent programming skills are essential. Experience in analysing genomic, RNA-seq and mass-spec data is highly desirable but not essential. Previous experience in pathway analysis and/or network modelling is highly valued.

Candidates are encouraged to contact Dr Giovanni Stracquadanio in advance by email  (g.stracquadanio@essex.ac.uk) to discuss their application.
