As part of the PhD program in Computer Science at University of Essex,
I am looking for a PhD student in computational and synthetic biology.  
The ideal candidate is interested in designing new biological design automation
methods for genome scale projects and/or network modelling of genomic,
transcriptomic and proteomic data.  
Candidates interested in developing optimization algorithms for biological problems are encouraged to apply as well.  
  
A summary of the research work in the lab can be found at: www.stracquadanio.me  

The deadline for the application is 28/02/2017, but it is highly recommended to
