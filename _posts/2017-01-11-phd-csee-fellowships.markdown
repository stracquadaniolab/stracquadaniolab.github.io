As part of the PhD program in Computer Science at University of Essex,
I am looking for a PhD student to work in the fields of computational and synthetic biology,
particularly in the areas of biological design automation and/or
network modeling of transcriptomic and proteomic data.  
Students with interests in optimization and evolutionary computation
are encouraged to apply as well.  

For any further information, please contact me by email at:  (mailto:g.stracquadanio@essex.ac.uk)[g.stracquadanio (at) essex.ac.uk]
