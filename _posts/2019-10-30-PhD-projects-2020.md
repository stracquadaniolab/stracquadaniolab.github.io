There are a number of new PhD projects available to work in the lab starting on October 2020. 

The ideal candidate has a background in mathematics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, physics or related fields. 
He/she is strongly motivated to develop a competitive profile in machine learning, data science and computational biology.
Candidates with a strong biology background but aiming at transitioning to computational research are welcome. 

It is strongly recommended to get in touch by email with Dr Stracquadanio to discuss their application in advance.
