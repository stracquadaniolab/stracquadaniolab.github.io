The complete design of the synthetic yeast genome has been published
in the last issue of Science as a cover story.  

The paper describes the computational framework and the assembly strategy used to build the Sc2.0 genome.  
We also described the synthesis of 5 other synthetic chromosomes, and the 3D structure of SCRaMbLEd genomes.
