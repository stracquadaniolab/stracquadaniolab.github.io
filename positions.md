The lab is looking for talented students and postdocs to help us develop methods
to understand biological systems in physiological and pathological states, and
build synthetic molecules and genomes to address healthcare needs. Check our
[research](/research) and [publications](/publications) page to see our recent
research interests.

Ideal computational applicants should have a strong experience in machine learning,
statistics, algorithms and computational biology, in particular sequencing
analysis and synthetic DNA design. Proven programming experience and fluency in
using Unix systems is required prior to start. 

### How to join

* **Postdocs**: Email Dr Stracquadanio your CV, 1 recent research article and a
  1-page statement with your research experience, your areas of interest and how
  you fit and can contribute to the team. Please, arrange 2 reference letters to
  be sent directly to Dr Stracquadanio. 

* **PhD students**: Email Dr Stracquadanio your CV and 1-page statement with
  your research interests and describing how your formal training would allow
  you to succeed as a graduate student, and how you would fit with the lab.
  Please, arrange 1 reference letter to be sent directly to Dr Stracquadanio. 

*  **Undergraduate students**: We welcome undergraduate students to join the
   team to get research experience. However, to be productive, students should
   have already taken relevant programming, mathematics or bioinformatics
   modules.
