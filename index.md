We are a research group in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering
at the University of Essex. We are interested in computational methods
to analyse big biological data and design synthetic organisms.  
Our work ranges from CAD tools for genome engineering, to optimization methods
for biological circuits design, to proteomics network clustering
to statistical mechanics of chromosome looping.
