We are a research group based at the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning complex phenotypes and diseases, using a data-driven synthetic biology approach. We focus on developing machine learning methods to dissect the genetic architecture of cancer, as well as computer aided design methods for synthetic genomics. Our group is extremely interdisciplinary and includes members with engineering, biology and informatics background.
