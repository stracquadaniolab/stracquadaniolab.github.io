We are a research group in the [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](http://www.essex.ac.uk/csee)
at the [University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk).  
We are interested in computational methods to analyse big biological data and design synthetic organisms to understand the underpinning mechanisms of complex phenotypes and disease.  
Our work ranges from CAD tools for genome engineering, to optimization methods
for biological circuits design, to proteomics network clustering
to statistical mechanics of chromosome looping.
