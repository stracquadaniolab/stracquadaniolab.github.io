We are a research group in the [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](http://www.essex.ac.uk/csee)
at the [University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk).  
We are interested in computational methods to analyse biological big data and design synthetic genomes to understand the underpinning mechanisms of complex phenotypes and disease. Our work ranges from Bayesian learning and deep learning for cancer genetics to CAD methods for genome engineering, to network inference and clustering.
