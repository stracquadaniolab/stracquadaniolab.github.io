We are a research group at the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology)
at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).  
We are interested in computational methods to build and analyse genomes to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning complex phenotypes and diseases.
We particularly focus on _Computer Aided Engineering_ (CAE) methods for synthetic genomics and inference methods for cancer genomics and genetics.

<!-- analyse biological big data and design synthetic genomes to understand the underpinning mechanisms of complex phenotypes and disease. Our work ranges from Bayesian learning and deep learning for cancer genetics to CAD methods for genome engineering, to network inference and clustering. -->
