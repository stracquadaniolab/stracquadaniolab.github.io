I am a Ph.D. student in synthetic biology at the University of Edinburgh. My research work is focused on computer aided design (CAD) methods for synthetic biology.  

I obtained a M.Sc. in Biology summa cum laude in 2014 from the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. During my thesis, I worked at the Institute of Food Sciences of Italian National Research Council, in Angelo Facchiano's lab. Here I developed a database about nutraceutical food and compounds and on finding natural inhibitors for the protein AKT1.
