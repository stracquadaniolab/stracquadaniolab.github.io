Giovanni Stracquadanio is a senior lecturer in synthetic biology at the University of Edinburgh. His research work focuses on computational methods to design synthetic biological systems and analyse genomic big data. His lab is currently working on computer aided engineering (CAE) methods for synthetic genomics and multi-omics inference to identify genetic mutations increasing the risk of cancer. In 2017, Dr Stracquadanio received the Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Science.

Dr Stracquadanio obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Catania in 2010. He received postdoctoral training in synthetic biology in Joel Bader and Jef Boeke labs at Johns Hopkins University and in cancer genetics at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Oxford. Dr Stracquadanio was instrumental in the Synthetic Yeast (Sc2.0) genome project, designing algorithms and software to design and analyse synthetic yeast chromosomes.
