Giovanni Stracquadanio is a Senior Lecturer in Synthetic Biology at the University of Edinburgh. His lab focuses on Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) methods for synthetic genomics and machine learning methods for cancer genomics and genetics. 


Dr Stracquadanio obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Catania (Italy) in 2010. He received postdoctoral training in synthetic biology in Joel Bader and Jef Boeke labs at the Johns Hopkins University working on the synthetic yeast genome. Dr Stracquadanio is a main contributor to the Synthetic Yeast (Sc2.0) genome project, pioneering algorithms and developing software at the foundation of the first synthetic eukaryotic genome. He has also developed tools used in large-scale synthesis projects, streamlining chromosomes engineering and the assembly of biological pathways. 
In 2014, he moved to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Oxford to work on cancer genetics, in Gareth Bondâ€™s lab; here, he focused on studying how high-frequency inherited p53 mutations affect the risk of cancer. 
In 2016, Dr Stracquadanio established the first computational biology lab at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering of the University of Essex, and in 2017 received the Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Science. 
In 2019, he joined the School of Biological Sciences at University of Edinburgh as a Senior Lecturer in synthetic biology.
