I am a Biomedical Engineer and a former student of the University of Pisa, where I obtained my BSc Biomedical Engineering (2014) and MSc Biomedical Engineering (2017). My core competencies involve statistical data analysis, programming, electronics and Fourier analysis.  

I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Quantitative Biology at the University of Edinburgh. My research interest lies in the fields of statistical genetics, machine learning and network discovery optimization methods. My present focus is on using large datasets as GWAS to decode the biological networks underpinning cancer biology.
