I am a Biomedical Engineer and a former student of the University of Pisa, where I obtained my BSc Biomedical Engineering (2014) and MSc Biomedical Engineering (2017). My core competencies involve statistical data analysis, programming, electronics and Fourier analysis.  

I am currently enrolled in a PhD course at the University of Essex, in the CSEE department. My research interest lies in the fields of statistical genetics, machine learning and network discovery optimization methods. My present focus is on using large datasets as GWAS to decode the biological networks underpinning cancer biology.
